## AFC East

# Patriots

With no Cam Newton taking rushing attempts, the running backs got their share. Damien Harris, in his first game, got the bulk of the load with 17 carries, Burkhead followed with 17, James White was the primary pass catcher with 3 rushes but 8 targets for 7 receptions. I’m not sure if we should expect this to continue given Belichick’s unpredictable RB track record and Cam returning eventually, but the coaching staff was high on Harris coming in and he showed out. Hoyer/Stidham went to N’Keal Harry and Julian Edelman about as much as Cam did, each with 6 targets, but the sent 10 targets to Damiere Byrd, who has been rising each week this year, could be something to watch.

# Bills

Zack Moss didn't play again allowing Singletary to possibly pull away from the committee that underperformed in the first 2 weeks. Singletary got 18 carries and 6 targets with 4 receptions upping his year’s touch share almost 5 percent to 32.2. For receiving, it remains the main 3 guys in Diggs, Beasly, and Brown who make up around 58 percent of all targets.

# Dolphins

Miles Gaskin’s touch share went down a couple percentage points but his rush share remained pretty much the same at 45 percent, while the shares of the other running backs went down slightly, so it is still his backfield. Davante Parker and Isaiah Ford lead the team by far in targets with 12 and 10 respectively while Mike Gesicki and Preston Williams each had a somewhat disappointing 3 each. Worse is that each of those 2 have the worst catch rating on the team, they’ve yet to make a solid consistent connection with Fitzpatrick.

# Jets

Not much change in the backfield without Le’Veon Bell, still remains Gore then Perine. However in the receiving game Jamison Crowder’s return showed he remains the guy to own on the Jets getting 10 targets and 7 receptions, tying for the season lead in targets and now in the lead for receptions despite just playing 2 games.

## AFC North

# Ravens

Another somewhat 4 headed monster in the run game. Lamar Jackson had 7 carries, Mark Ingram 8, Gus Edwards 9, and J.K. Dobbins 5. Harbaugh seems committed to spreading the load and keeping guys fresh. Hollywood Brown increased his target share lead Sunday as the number 1 receiver with Mark Andrews behind him.

# Browns

Nick Chubb went down with just 6 carries on the day. In his absence, Kareem Hunt got 11, Dontrell Hilliard got 5, and surprisingly, D’Ernest Johnson got 13. Karrem hunt looks to be the main guy going forward if Chubb misses time but Kevin Stefansky may be committed to sharing the load. Not much changed in the passing game with Odell having 7 targets along with Austin Hooper and Jarvis Landry getting 6. What might be something to watch is Odell had 2 carries, one going for huge yards, maybe earning himself more creative ways to get the ball in his hands.

# Bengals

Joe Mixon had himself a day, getting 25 carries, 6 targets and receptions and finding the endzone 3 times. It was against an not too amazing Jags defense but he may have earned more touches going forwards, and upped his touch share on the season to 40 percent. AJ Green seems to be falling off a bit, earning 3 less targets than Tyler Boyd, who may have reached the number 1 spot, and 2 less than rookie Tee Higgins. His catch rate also remains under 50 percent.

## AFC South

# Jaguars

James Robinson increased his season touch share with 17 carries and 4 targets that were all caught. Laviska Shenault remains in second with 1 carry and 5 catches on the day as he and Keelan Cole each had 6 targets behind the return of DJ Chark who had 9 targets for 8 receptions taking back his number 1 spot in this receiving core.

# Colts

The running backs remain the focal point of this offense with Taylor, Wilkins, and Hines being the top 3 in touch shares. Taylor is the main guy still with Wilkins and Hines about even for number 2. Zach Pascal led the team in targets with 8 but only had 2 receptions to show for it. TY had 5 with 3 receptions and TE Mo Allie-Cox had just 1 reception on 2 targets. Philip has yet to really have a solid connection with any of his receivers, a few of whom are hurt, but the running backs keep getting their share.

# Texans

David Johnson remained by far the main guy in the backfield even after Duke Johnson’s return even increasing his season touch share. A lot of guys got looked at in the receiving game today with 8 players getting at least 3 targets, led by Fuller with 7. 6 and almost 7 guys have at least 10 percent of the target share, but things may change after the O’Brien firing with Romeo Crennel stepping in.

## AFC West

![AFC West week 4 1](/assets/AFC_West_4_1.PNG)

# Chargers

With Ekeler hurt, expect Joshua Kelley to be the main guy now with Justin Jackson getting some number 2 work. With Herbert still at the helm, Keenan Allen has continued to feast with 12 targets Sunday. However, nobody else got more than 3 as some seemingly unknown names got a target or 2 spread their way. Hebert looked great against a Bucs D that looked great until this game so expect the offense to continue to click and guys like Hunter henry to see more targets in future games.

# Chiefs

Clyde remains the guy at running back. Kelce was held to just 3 catches from 6 targets against a tough Pats D that held Waller to just 2 catches last week so don’t expect that to continue. Sammy Watkins led the team in targets now moving to just behind Tyreek Hill in the season’s target share, and Mecole Hardman now has more targets on the season than Demarcus Robinson, possibly solidifying himself as the 3rd WR.

# Raiders

Josh Jacobs remains the large majority shareholder out of the backfield but his touch share fell on Sunday as the Raiders passed a lot more. Waller is back on track with 12 targets and Hunter Renfrow got 8 his way. Surprisingly, Zay Jones was 3rd with 6 after just 4 targets all year, which may change when Henry Ruggs comes back from injury but could be something to keep an eye on.

# Broncos

Melvin Gordon increased his lead on the teams touch share with Lindsay missing another week, not over 40 percent. Rypien surprisingly went to Tim Patrick the most of Jerry Juedy and Noah Fant getting 7 targets compared to 6 and 4 respectively. Those 3 have a large lead on the season target share with Melvin Gordon next far behind.

## NFC East

# Football Team

The roles in the backfield are becoming clearer now. Gibson is the main guy, getting 13 rushes compared to the next highest being 3 for Peyton Barber. McKissic is the main pass catcher getting 8 targets in that realm, but Gibson will still have a role in the passing game getting 5 for himself. Each week Gibson seems to have a larger share and I expect it to continue as he keeps performing. For the rest of the passing game it was little surprise, McLaurin, Thomas, and Inman were the main guys.

# Giants

Devonta Freeman seems to be separating himself as the back to own in this backfield, getting 11 carries to Gallman’s 6, and 4 targets to Dion Lewis’ 3. He already has double the average touches than both of them on their own and just more than the two combined.  Evan Engram now has the lead in the team’s target share with Slayton close behind, then Tate in a distant 3rd. However, out of the receiver, Tate has by far the best catch percentage while Engram and Slayton’s are pretty sub par.

# Eagles

Miles Sanders is still by far the main guy, however the passing game is tough to dissect. Greg Ward, Zach Ertz, John Hightower, and Richard Rodgers are the only guys in the WR/TE group that have played every game. Sunday had few targets to go around as even though it was basically just them as Greg Ward got 7 and Ertz just 5. If this offense is ever fully healthy we’ll have a better idea about how they’ll turn out.

# Cowboys

Amari Cooper keeps his insane lead in the target share, now over 25 percent after 16 targets Sunday. Next is CeeDee Lamb and Dalton Shultz at around 14 percent and each had 8 targets. Cedrick Wilson once again got more targets than Gallup as Gallup may be falling down the depth chart.

## NFC North

![NFC North week 4 1](/assets/NFC_North_4_1.PNG)

# Packers

Aaron Jones maintained his touch share Monday night, but with a limited receiving core, Jamaal Williams also got a lot of looks with 8 carries and 8 catches. 8 targets was tied for the most with Valdes-Scantling who was only able to bring 4 in. Tonyan got 6 his way and also brought just 4 in. The Packers are heading into a bye and presumably Adams will be back after to regain control of the receiving game.

# Bears

With no Tarik Cohen, David Montgomery wasn’t given the share of opportunities I expected but maintained his touch share on the year. Nick Foles continued to give ARob some love with 10 targets and he increased his catch percentage with 7 receptions. Darnell Mooney surprised with 9 targets for 5 catches. Anthony Miller and Jimmy Graham got 5 each.

![NFC North week 4 2](/assets/NFC_North_4_2.PNG)

# Vikings

Dalvin Cook did Dalvin cook things and increased his touch share. Adam Theilen remains the number 1 guy by far getting 10 targets his way for 8 receptions, and Justin Jefferson was second with 5 and may have solidified himself as the number 2.

# Lions

Adrian Peterson once again lead the team in rushing by far, with Swift leading the passing game. Kerryon might have been relegated to the 3rd back at this point. Galloday once again led the team in targets with 8, nobody else got more than 4.

## NFC South

![NFC South week 4 1](/assets/NFC_South_4_1.PNG)

# Saints

Latavius got a lot of rushes, 14 to be exact, but this is still Kamara’s backfield. With Jared Cook and Tre’Quan’ Smith getting hurt, Emmanuel Sanders was able to get 9 targets his way. It'll be interesting to see how it continues with the addition of guys getting healthy.

#  Falcons

Todd Gurley seemed to fend off Brian Hill from creeping up on him. The receiving core Monday night was kind of a mess with Calvin Ridley getting 5 targets with 0 catches, Julio only played in the first half, and Russell gage only got 3 targets. Somehow, Olamide Zaccheaus led the team with 9. I don’t really know what to make of this other than Zaccheaus, nobody else was fully healthy.

![NFC South week 4 2](/assets/NFC_South_4_2.PNG)

# Buccaneers

No Leonard Fournette meant a full day for Ronald Jones, 20 rushes , 9 targets, 6 catches, and raised his touch share by 5 percent. Without Godwin playing, Mike Evans had 8 targets, Scotty Miller 7, and OJ Howard had 6. Justin Watson also had 6 which I do not expect to continue when Godwin is back. The Bucs threw the ball a lot in a shootout, and a lot of guys got opportunities.

# Panthers

Mike Davis once again came through with no McCaffrey, Reggie Bonnafon had 10 carries and 2 receptions but is now heading to IR so more work is expected for Davis. Robby Anderson has now passed DJ Moore in target shae getting 10 targets to Moore’s 6 and has a better catch percentage by far than Moore.

## NFC West

![NFC West week 4 1](/assets/NFC_West_4_1.PNG)

# Rams

Malcom Brown got 1 more carry and 5 more targets to Henderson keeping the Rams backfield unpredictable, especially with Cam Akers expected to come back this week. Woods and Kupp tied for the most targets with 7, Higbee was next with 4 which is expected.

# Cardinals

Kenyan Drake pretty much maintained his touch share, and Hopkins once again led the team in targets. With Christian Kirk back Andy Isabella got less targets but still got 3 his way.

![NFC West week 4 2](/assets/NFC_West_4_2.PNG)

# Seahawks

Surprisingly, Chris Carson didn't miss any time yet Hyde actually did, so Carson actually increased his touch share on the season. Tyler Lockett saw a drop in targets only getting 4 while Metcalf got 6 and Greg Olsen led the team with 7. Lockett still has a quarter of the target share, however.

# 49ers

Jerrick Mickinnon got 11 rushes and 11 targets earning lead on the team's touch shares. Mostert is expected back so it’ll be interesting to see if McKinnon has earned a larger role going forward. Deebo Samuel got 3 targets and receptions in his return, look for that to increase as he gets eased back in. George Kittle went off in his first game back with 15 targets and 15 catches showing who the real number 1 receiver is. The flashy rookie Brandon Aiyuk got 5 targets and a rush showing he is still involved as guys get healthy.
