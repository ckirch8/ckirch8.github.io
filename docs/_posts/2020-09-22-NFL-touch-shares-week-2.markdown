## AFC East

# Patriots

Cam new still seems to be the guy getting the bulk of the rushes through week 2. Week 2 saw the emergence of Damiere Byrd with 9 targets and 6 receptions after seeing nothing in week 1. Edelman and Harry matched their opportunities from week 1.

# Bills

Still no clear RB1 from the backfield with Singletary and Moss splitting carries once again, though singletary did log 2 mor attempts for what it's worth. Diggs, Brown, and Beasly had similar opportunities as last week.

# Dolphins

Miles Gaskin seems to have emerged as the main guy in the backfield, leading in carries and by far in targets and receptions. The team still seems to be spreading the attempts around but Gaskin has been the sole pass catcher. With 46 targets to go around, Mike Gesicki and Isaiah Ford had the most opportunities now 1 and 2 on the season in target shares with Parker falling to 3rd. This was the emergence of Gesicki people were hoping for drafting him as a sleeper, and Frod may be someone to watch. Preston Williams fell behind those three only logging 5 targets vs 7 last week.

# Jets

With Crowder out Darnold spread the ball out a bit more. Braxton Berrios was the main beneficiary, not Herndon who many expected to feast in targets. Don't look for this to continue however when Cordwer comes back. With Le'Veon hurt, Frank Gore dominated the backfield touches.

## AFC North

# Ravens

Dobbins didn't follow up his impressive week 1 performance with many opportunities =, though he did break off a big run in one of his 2 attempts. Mark Andrews was limited to just 3 targets while Hollywood Brown remained the top WR. Everyone else had similar production.

# Steelers

Conner came roaring back in week 2 showing it is still his backfield to lose. Diontae Johnson solidified himself as Ben's favorite target so far, with Juju second, and Claypool as a deep threat. Ben also went to the tight ends more than we did in week 1.

# Browns

Chubb out touched Hunt this past week unlike week 1 but both were still used heavily. Odell still remains the top target, but this offense seems to run heavily through the backs through 2 weeks.

# Bengals

Mixon still dominated the rush attempts and got a little more targets out of the backfield too this week, but Gio Bernard still held down his role as the 3rd down and late game pass catcher. Burrow went to the tight ends a ton in week 2, 15 targets in all. Drew Sample will be someone to watch after the Uzomah injury. AJ Green is still depended on heavily, and Tyler boyd remains the clear second receiver.

## AFC South

# Jaguars

James Robinson dominates the backfield once again, and got more work in the passing game this week. The team still found creative ways to get the ball to Laviska Shenault, second on the team in touches. Week 2 also saw a big game from Minshew, but he spread the ball to seemingly everyone on the roster. 7 guys logged 4 targets with Keelan Cole leading the team with 7, his second straight week leading the team.

# Titans

As expected, Derrick Henry is the only one running the ball really, with 82% of the rush share. With no AJ Brown, the targets stayed mainly with Adam Humphries, Corey Davis, and Jonnu Smith which isn't a surprise based on how the shares were after week 1.

# Colts

Well after expecting Jonathan Taylor and Nyheim Hines' touches to go up, only Taylor's did. Jordan Wilkins seemed to take the second back role with 9 attempts vs no attempts and 1 catch for Hines which is surprising. TY remains to be getting most of the receiver targets but has only caught half of them. Michael Pittman figured to be the second receiver after the Campbell injury and we may have seen the emergence of Mo Alie-Cox at tight end after the Doyle injury.

# Texans

David Johnson nearly matched his opportunities from week 1. What is surprising is Will Fuller not getting a single look after 10 targets week 1. Tight end Jordan Akins and Brandin Cooks seemed to have their roles increased in the bizarre void. This is promising for Cooks who disappointed fantasy owners in week 1.

## AFC West

# Chargers

Rookie Josh Kelley had 7 more attempts than the presumed starter Austin Ekeler. This may trend to a 50/50 split over the season or possibly even Kelley as the number 1. With rookie Justin Herbert starting, it seems everyone but Mike Williams saw their opportunities and production go up vs week 1 with Tyrod Taylor. With Coach Lynn wanting to stick with Tyrod, they may go back down a bit, but promising for Allen and Henry owners if Herbert ever fully takes over.

# Chiefs

Clyde Edwards-Helaire only logged 10 rushes this week, likely due to being down the whole game. He did see a huge increase in the passing game which is a good sign for Clyde owners. Kelce saw the bulk of the targets week 2 vs week 1 which was more spread out. Sammy Watkins saw his share go way down leading the team in target week 1 but only getting 3 week 2.

# Raiders

Darren Waller has arrived. After leading in target share week 1, he dominated week 2 now up to 39% on the year so far, largest in the league. This is still a Josh Jacobs backfield as well, logging 1 more touch than last week.

# Broncos

Melvin Gordan had the bulk fo the load out of the backfield with Lindsay hurt, Royce Freeman also logged 5 touches. With the Sutton injury, Jeudy seems the number 1, with Fant and Hamler following. Tim Patrick looks to be involved as well.

## NFC East

# Washington Football Team

Antonio Gibson's role increased week 2, now leading the team in touches, though Barber and McKissic were still involved. For the passing game, similar story to week 1, Logan Thomas and Terry MacLaurin getting the most looks with Steven Sims and Dontrel Inman behind them.

# Giants

With the Saquon injury, the backfield is now unclear. Dion Lewis got the looks during the game but 2rd string rb Wayne Gallman was inactive. The team may also look to sign Devonta Freeman. Through 2 weeks, Engram and Slayton seem to be the main guys in the passing game with Shepard then Tate behind them.

# Eagles

With Sanders back, he was the clear number 1 in terms of touches earning 23 to Boston Scott's 7. Goedert once again lead the team in targets while Ertz had now fallen behind Desean Jackson in the teams target share through 2 weeks.

# Cowboys

Nothing new with zeke, he is the guy. Amari Cooper is the clear number 1 receiver. Interestingly, rookie Ceedee Lamb has had a larger target share than Michael Gallup through 2 weeks. Dalton Schultz, the tight end serving as the starter post Blake Jarwin's injury had a huge day logging 10 targets with 9 catches and could be big in this offense.

## NFC North

# Packers

Aaron Jones dominated this offense week 2. After a huge week 1, Davante Adams only saw 3 targets but was taken out of the game for a hamstring injury. Luckily it seems to be precautionary and he should be back next week. Lazard and MVC only saw small increases in his absence.

# Bears

Backfield has played out as expected with Montgomery the main guy, and getting the ball to Cohen and Patterson in changes of pace. Allen Robinson once again saw a high target low reception game, seeing 18 targets with only 8 receptions on the season so far. That seems to be the story with a lot of the receivers to be honest, with Mitch only completing 59% of his passes.

# Vikings

Dalvin Cook is taking most of the touches on this team, and Theilen by far most of the targets. No other receivers are getting a lot of opportunities.

# Lions

The backfield was split fairly evenly week 2, with 10 touches for Swift, 8 for Johnson, and 7 for Peterson. his is actually the opposite of the order week 1, showing swift may be taking over the backfield. The Lions were down most of the game which is possibly why Peterson, more of a runner, saw less time. With Stafford throwing 10 less times in week 2, Quintex Cephus suffered the most going from 10 to 3 targets. With the return of Galloday week 3, expect the current target shares to change a lot going forward.

## NFC South

# Saints

Kamara took back the lead in touches after last week with Latavius Murray only getting 4 in week 2 compared to Kamara's 21. On the receivers' end, things are not looking great as Brees could not get much going Monday night. Tre'Quan Smith followed by Deonte Harris and Jared cook lead the night in targets in Michael Thomas' absence, with Sanders having a very disappointing night logging just 1 catch.

# Falcons

Gurley once again had most of the touches out of the abckfield, but was not used in the passing game this week. Ridley and Gage backed up their week 1 performances with big weeks again while Julio seemed to be banged up and got less looks, though he did drop a sure TD from a wr pass by Gage. Hayden Hurst also got into the action more with 8 targets and 5 catches.

# Buccaneers

Ronald Jones II and Fournette split the carries this week but Fournette did much more in the passing game, which could spell bad news for Jones as Fournette could chip away a larger share each week if he performs like he did Sunday. Lesean Mccoy also got a cunk of touches through the passing game.  Mike Evans and Brady seemed to figure it out week 2 with no Godwin, while the tight ends didn't get much going their way.

# Panthers

With McCaffrey out a few weeks, Mike Davis seems to be in line for more touches, but keep and eye on Curtis Samuel. Samuel has had more rushes than Davis while McCaffrey was playing and was used a lot in the running game in college. DJ Moor continued to get the largest target share and Robby Anderson stayed close behind.

## NFC West

# Rams

Injuries to Malcom Brown and Cam Akers gave Darrell Henderson the most opportunities Sunday. The backfield remains to be a 3 headed dragon, though id Akers is out it maybe be  1-2 punch next week. In the passing game the ball was evenly spread between Woods (5 targets), Kupp (6 targets), Van Jefferson (5 targets), and Higbee (5 targets), though Higbee benefitted the most with 3 touchdowns. McVay seems to continue to get everyone on his offense involved.

# Cardinals

Kenyan Drake remains the clear number 1 running back, though Kyler will still get his share on the ground, and Edmonds will be more involved in the passing game. Hopkins is by far the number 1 receiver still, getting 35% of the target share this year, with Fitz an Christian Kirk as the 2 and 3.

# Seahawks

Carson proved it was his backfield week 2 out-touching Carlos Hyde 19 to 7. The receiving game remains the Lockett and Metcalf show, with Carson and David Moore behind them. Greg Olsen only received 1 target in week 2 after his strong performance week 1.

# 49ers

With all of their injuries, it is hard to tell where the 49ers are or will be. Jimmy G and Shanahan seem to love their tight ends in the passing game, so if Kittle is ready to go he is the guy but Reed did great in his absence. Kendrick Bourne has been the most targeted receiver but that may change as guys are coming back from injury. In the running game is seems they are down to Jerrick McKinnon who only has 9 touches on the year but has done a lot with them, and Jeff Wislon. It is unclear how they will move forward.
