# AFC East

## Patriots

Sony Michel and Rex Burkhead got a lot of opportunities Sunday with Michel getting 11 carries and 2 targets, both season highs, and Burkhead getting 6 carries and leading the team in targets with 10 on the day with 7 receptions. The game plan was running heavy against the Raiders and WRs took a hit with Edelman getting 6 targets and Harry 4, both below their averages for the first 2 games. They still remain the only WRs with any significant usage though.

## Bills

With Zach Moss out, Devin Singletary received the bulk of the load out of the backfield logging a season high in carries and 5 targets with 4 receptions. He made the most of his opportunity so I wouldn't be surprised to see Moss’ usage go down in the future. Receiving wise, Dawson Knox didn’t play and John Brown left the game after just 2 targets. Tyler Kroft was the biggest beneficiary getting 5 targets and 4 receptions, where Beasly and Diggs had similar type targets as they have through the first 2 weeks.

## Dolphins

Miles Gaskin is officially the guy in Miami. 22 rushes and 5 receptions improved his season touch share over 8% to lead the team by far. The passing attack slowed down in week 3 with only 20 passes to go around after averaging 38 the first 2 weeks. Almost every receiver saw their target down and Davante Parker was the only one who didn’t need a touchdown to save his day, who now leads the receivers in receptions.

## Jets

Frank Gore increased his lead on the team’s touch lead with 15 carries and a reception. La’Mical Perine seems to be the number 2 in that backfield now. Braxton Berrios, Chris Herndon, Chris Hogan seemed once again as the main guys with newcomer Lawrence Cager also getting 4 looks his way. This offense and overall team looks pretty bleak so there isn’t too much interesting information here.

# AFC North

## Ravens

Running backs have simply not had that many carries go their way this year. Lamar once again led the team having 9, Ingram had 7, Edwards 4, and Dobbins 1. Even though the offense is run heavy, the backs don’t have that much value compared to last year. Andrews had a lot of looks compared to last week but could only turn 8 targets into 2 receptions. Similar story for Brown with 6 targets and 2 receptions. JK Dobbins actually led the team with just 4, as the offense struggled all night. Hopeful this doesn’t keep up for the Ravens but the last few weeks have shown not much fantasy value on the team.

## Steelers

James Conner Remains the guy in Pittsburg increasing his touch share to nearly 30%. Diontae Johnson, the leading receiver coming into the week got hurt early on allowing James Washington and Eric Ebron to really increase their shares. Should Johnson miss more time expect Ben to spread the ball around.

## Browns

Nick Chubb and Kareem Hunt remain as the dominant touch getters on this team with Chubb the number 1 and hunt not far behind. 65% of all offensive touches go to one of these 2 guys. Odell still is the main receiver with Jarvis and Hooper 2 and 3, and not much else behind them.

## Bengals

Mixon remains by far the leading touch getter even though he hasn’t been able to do much with them. Tyler Boyd led the team in targets with 13 with the rookie Tee Higgins surprisingly behind him with 9. Drew Sample disappointingly followed up his big week last week with just one target. AJ Green still leads the team in targets, but Boyd is not far behind and Higgins may be someone to watch.

# AFC South

## Jaguars

James Robinson had an emergence in the passing game this week while still dominating the rush attempts. Chris Thompson got a lot of playing time late but that was due to the Jags being down big and he is the more experienced receiver, but I could see Robinson eating into the late game comeback lineups too with how he looked Thursday. Without DJ Chark, Chris Conley actually led the team in targets with 8 while Laviska Shenault with 6 then Keelan Cole with 5 followed behind him. Laviska only got 1 carry this game, yet remains second on the team in touches.

## Titans

Derrick remains at about half the touches for the team. And once again, receiving wise Adam Humphries, Corey Davis, and Jonnu Smith split the targets fairly evenly. This offense has been somewhat predictable in that sense and should only expect to change once AJ Brown comes back.

## Colts

Nyheim Hines got a share of the backfield this week with 7 carries and 5 targets. Wilkins had 9 carries and Taylor 13 showing Hines is still mainly a receiving back. Outside of Hines, Rivers spread the ball around fairly evenly. Hilton had 3 targets, Mo Allie-Cox 3 as well, with Pittman and Pascal each getting 4. With Pittman likely to miss time it will be interesting to see who benefits the most.

## Texans

Texans haven’t really brought in a number 2 back as David Johnson increases his touch share for the season this week. Will Fuller followed up his 0 target week with 5 for 4 receptions. Other than that, the target shares for the season have remained fairly similar to last week.

# AFC West

## Chargers

As we talked about last week, Justin Herbert was good for all skill players again. Ekeler took back the number 1 spot in the backfield this week earning 12 carries and 11 targets vs just 8 carries and a target for Kelley. Keenan Allen got a lot of attention with 19 targets his way and Hunter henry got a healthy 7. Once again, Mike Williams and Herbert don’t seem to have a great connection as he only gets 1 target.

## Chiefs

Clyde had another impressive performance with 2 carries and 6 targets. Mahomes Spread the ball around in the passing game with 5 players getting at lead 6 targets and Sammy Watkins having the most with 8. Unlike the Ravens, this offense was clicking and everyone got involved and should show real promise going forward.

## Raiders

Going against the Patriots was tough for the Raiders. Jacobs didn’t lose too many opportunities but the Pats held Darren Waller to just 4 targets and 2 catches. Hunter Renfrow was the one who got open the most earning a season high 9 targets with 6 catches. Did Bill put out a blueprint on how to stop the elite tight end or are the Patriots just the Patriots and things will go back to what the first 2 weeks were? It will be interesting to see.

## Broncos

Well we got to see what a full game with Jeff Driskel would be. Playing against an admittedly tough defense, Melvin Gordon got just 8 carries but 6 targets to maintain his large touch share. Driskel threw to tight end Noah Fant 10 times and rookie Jerry Juedy 9 times so look for them to have solid production throughout the year. KJ Hamler, a guy I had my eye on as a possible breakout player was third in targets with 5, and Tim Patrick had 4. Driskel is unlikely to go Thursday so things may be shaken up again. 

# NFC East

## Washington Football Team

Antonio Gibson continues to slowly increase his role in the offense once again leading the team in touches, with McKissic seeming to take the number 2 role. Once again, Haskins loves Terry MacLaurin and Logan Thomas. This time, however, he shut out Steven Sims and Dontrel Inman became the clear number 3.

## Giants
With no Saquon it was going to be interesting to see what happens in the backfield. Well, playing down almost the entire game to a decimated 49ers team, they rushed the ball 10 total times. Newcomer Devonta Freeman got 5, Wayne Gallman got 4, and Dion Lewis got 1. Both Lewis and Gallman had 3 targets. So nobody really took the backfield and I don’t expect anyone to honestly with how bad the whole team has performed. Darius Slayton now has the largest target share tying for the lead on the day with Golden Tate with 7. Engram followed with 5.

## Eagles

Mile Sanders had a good day increasing his lead on the touch share with 18 carries and 7 targets for 4 receptions. Both Goedert and Desean Jackson got hurt during this game so expect to see Ertz lead on the target share to increase with Greg Ward following after an 11 target day Sunday.

## Cowboys

Nothing new about the backfield with Zeke. In the passing game Michal Galup made up some ground on Ceedee Lamb who even had 1 less target than Cedrick Wilson, a guy with 0 targets coming into the game. Amari Cooper remains the clear 1, and Shultz remained active.

# NFC North

![NFC North week 3](/assets/NFC_North_3.PNG)

## Packers

Aaron Jones increased his touch share slightly showing nothing changed in the backfield. With Devante Adams out, it was Adam Lazard, not Marquez Valdes-Scantling who benefited the most doubling the targets of MVS. Rodgers also went to the tight ends a lot giving Jace Sternberger, Marcedes Lewis, and Robert Tonyan a combined 10 targets. However, this will be temporary as even missing almost one and a half games, Adams still has the lead on the target share.

## Bears

There’s a new QB in town so things may be shaken up. Tarik Cohen also tore his ACL so look for David Montgomery’s role to increase. Allen Robinson looks to get even more looks his way with hopefully balls he can actually catch. Jimmy Graham had a big day as well when Foles hopped in. We’ll wait for next week to make larger conclusions on what Foles means to this offense but it looks promising for everyone involved… except Trubisky.

## Vikings

I didn’t say much about the Vikings last week but Justin Jefferson might have carved himself a real role in this offense having a massive day against the Titans. With a possible 1-2 punch in the making this offense could go back to what it was with Diggs now replaced by Jefferson.

## Lions

The backfield was led by Adrian Peterson Sunday showing some week to week unpredictability as Matt Patricia may follow a Belichick blueprint when it comes to running backs. Kenny Gallody was tied for the team lead in targets in his first game back and everyone other than TJ Hockenson saw their target drop. Galloday should end up the clear number 1 in this receiving core over the next few weeks.

# NFC South

![NFC South week 3](/assets/NFC_South_3.PNG)

## Saints

Even though Latavius Murray had 7 more carries than Alvin Kamara, Kamara had an insane 13 receptions on 14 targets. Drew Brees’ lack of arm strength may be the reason for this and it should continue as log as it’s working like it did Sunday night. Emmanuel Sanders had a bit of a better week with 5 targets and 4 receptions and Tre’Quan once again led the team in targets without Michael Thomas. Brees’ connection with Sanders may continue to grow but it will be interesting to see how it shakes out once Thomas ends up back in the lineup.

## Falcons

Todd Gurley had 14 carries and 2 targets compared to Brian Hill’s 9 carries and 3 targets. Gurley still has a hold on the backfield but it’s getting close and Hill may be a guy to keep an eye on. With Julio gone Calvin Ridley continued his breakout year getting 13 looks his way with a surprising Olamide Zaccheaus in second with 6. Gage and Hurst had 3 each. Julio may be key on getting other guys open in this passing game even if he isn't’ doing much like in week 2.

## Panthers

Mike Davis got the bulk of the carries in the absence of Christian McCaffrey with 13 and also earned an impressive 9 targets. Following up on our prediction of Curtis Samuel getting a lot more touches, he got 4 carries and 4 receptions, more than normal but not a huge increase. The passing game remained focused on Robby Anderson and DJ Moore which looks unlikely to change.

# NFC West

![NFC West week 3](/assets/NFC_West_3.PNG)

## Rams

Darrell Henderson led the backfield for the second week in a row with 20 carries vs Malcolm Browns 7. McVay is riding the hot hand here and Henderson is playing well so expect this to continue for the near future. Cooper Kupp led the team in targets for the first time this year with 10, Woods had 6 and Higbee only had 2. Josh Reynolds was able to get 5 his way despite just 3 on the year prior to Sunday. I think this continues the theme of McVay going to who’s hot. A lot of guys in this offense are going to get looks and if it’s working they’ll get many more.

## Cardinals

Kenyan Drake remains the guy in the backfield, and Hopkins as the guy in the passing game. A new development could be Andy Isabella in Christian Kirk's absence getting 5 targets and a touchdown, though if their name isn’t Drake or Hopkins, consistency might be hard to find.

## Seahawks

Chris Carson sprained his knee Sunday and it’s possible he misses some time. Carlos Hyde would figure to be the next man up with Tyler Homer also involved. Lockett and Metcalf remain where they have been each week. Greg Olsen had another nice week, but it may be hard to find consistency with the other weapons on the team. Don’t count on weekly looks for David Moore and Greg Olsen.

## 49ers

No Mostert and no Coleman meant yes Jerrick McKinnon and yes Jeff Wilson who each got 14 carries. Rookie Brandon Aiyuk got really involved with 3 carries and 8 targets, a guy who Shanahan has seemed keen on and someone who could be big in this offense. Outside of that injuries have really hurt this team as Reed went down, during the game as well. Kendrick Bourne has done a decent job at receiver but look for those returning from injuries to overtake him.
